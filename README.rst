Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient on PyTorch
======

Overview
======
The is the implementation of `Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient <https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971>`_ (DDPG) using `PyTorch <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch>`_. Part of the utilities functions such as replay buffer and random process are from `keras-rl <https://github.com/matthiasplappert/keras-rl>`_ repo. Contributes are very welcome. The repo is runnable and still in progress.

Dependencies
======
* Python 3
* PyTorch 0.1.9 
* `OpenAI Gym <https://github.com/openai/gym>`_

Run
======

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./main.py --debug


TODO
======
* Add experiement results
